# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

## Model auth (OAuth vs API key)

`src/runtime.ts` `resolveModel` must accept auth that carries EITHER an `apiKey` OR non-empty
`headers` (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer …`). Pi's OAuth providers (kimi-coding, xai, openai-codex,
anthropic OAuth, …) return headers-only auth from `getApiKeyAndHeaders`, and pi-ai providers treat a
caller-supplied `Authorization` header as a substitute apiKey. The acceptance rule mirrors pi's own
`AgentSession._getRequiredRequestAuth` (`result.auth.apiKey || result.auth.headers`). Do not
re-introduce a hard `apiKey` requirement — it breaks compaction/consolidation for every OAuth model.
Tests: `pnpm test` (vitest); typecheck: `pnpm typecheck`.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
